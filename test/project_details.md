# Project Overview

This project demonstrates a full-stack RAG application using several modern technologies.

* **Backend:** Node.js with the Express.js framework.
* **Frontend:** React.js, which provides a fast development environment via Vite.
* **Language Models:** Google's Gemini models, used for both embedding and generation.

* **Frameworks:** LlamaIndex and LangChain are used for orchestrating the RAG pipeline.

The application includes a chat interface and the ability to upload new documents to expand its knowledge base.
